    <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
    <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
    <p>
        One thing I found interesting is that emotional intelligence is able to be learned and it can help create the conditions for 
        happiness. In order to train emotional intelligence you start with training attention. This is because by having a “strong, 
        stable, and perceptive attention” it can help provide a sense of calmness and clarity. You will be able to look at things 
        objectively and pause before you act.
    </p>
    <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
    <p>
      To my surprise, when I did the two minutes of mindfulness I was able to have times when I felt calm. There was still many times 
      when my thoughts drifted but I didn’t feel as anxious when this happened. I have found that the Headspace app has really been 
      helping me with mindfulness. When I started using this app I had a thousand thoughts and my mind went elsewhere. I was thinking 
      of all the different things I needed to get done and I found that I got quite restless. However, I have since learned that 
      mindfulness is not about stopping thoughts but about viewing them with more perspective.
