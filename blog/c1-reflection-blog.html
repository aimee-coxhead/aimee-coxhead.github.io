        <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
          <p>I feel that EDA is going to be place that I can learn programming skills while also learning how to work well 
            with others. This is something that I am excited about because I believe you need to have both skill sets. 
          </p>
        <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
          <p>I am really excited to be part of EDA! I feel like I am going to be pushed outside of my comfort zone and 
              I will be learning a lot of news concepts, but I also feel I will be able to do this because of the supportive
             environment.</p>
        <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
          <p>I think that this type of culture of working with others will be something that I will enjoy being part of. 
            At times it can take me awhile to really open up to others, however, once I get to know people I find working 
            alongside and learning from others really rewarding. It is great that there are weekly ‘phase-0 group check ins’ 
            where I am able to meet others and start forming relationships before boot camp starts.</p>
        <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
          <p>I don't think my expectations of EDA have changed.</p>
        <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
          <p>I am very excited to be participating in this kind of learning environment as I like working with and learning 
            from others. I am also nervous, as I have the first fear Shereef mentioned in his video of "I don't know that 
            much"! However, when watching the video I was reassured that each person has a ton to offer and a ton to learn and 
            there are other people in the same position as me.</p>
