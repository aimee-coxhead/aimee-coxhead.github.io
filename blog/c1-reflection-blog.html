          <p>I am very excited to be participating in this kind of learning environment. I really like working and learning from others as I feel I have a lot to learn! I am also nervouse and have the fear that "I don't know that much!" but by watching the video I was reasured that each person has a ton to offer and a ton to learn.</p>
