      <h2>Daily Mindfulness</h2>
      <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>
      <p>
        While I initially thought that the mindfulness conversation was weird and uncomfortable after 
        awhile I ended up enjoying it. When I was speaking I was able to tell the other person how much 
        I appreciate them and they had to listen and take note of what I was saying. The other person 
        enjoyed this as when someone says something nice to them they can usually brush it off/say 
        something nice back and not take the compliment in. This time they did and appreciated what I was 
        saying. I found the listening part difficult as I really wanted to speak to the other person. I 
        now know that I probably jump into the conversation to early, thinking that I am contributing but 
        really I am not let the other person finish what they are saying. This is something that I will 
        need to work on in the future. 
      </p>
      <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
      <p>
          I will try to take one breath a day. As this is a very short amount of time each day, it will 
          allow me to commit to it and hopefully sustain it. 
      </p>
      <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
      <p>
        “Mindfulness is like exercise - You can only benefit from it with practice.”
