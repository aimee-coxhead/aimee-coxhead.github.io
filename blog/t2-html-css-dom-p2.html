    <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
    <p>
      It divides the page horizontally and vertically into columns and rows and these are used to order the elements on the page.

    <h3> What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
    <p>
      A webpage that is responsive means that the page will change/ resize depending on the device you are using to allow you to 
      view the page easily. This is a great feature as it allows people to view the website on a laptop or on a mobile phone and still 
      find the same information, just display differently due to the screen size. 
    </p>
    <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
    <p>
      In HTML, it is the use of tags to show the meaning of your content/ information in your webpage. It describes what each element is 
      to the browser and people viewing them. 
    </p>
    <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoyed learning how to use Bootstrap and this will be something I would like to play around with when I get the time.
