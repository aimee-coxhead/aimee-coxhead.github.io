        <h2>Meditation Process</h2>
        <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
        <p>
          I tried to look at what were the biggest things I needed to do in order to make my site functioning and how I could 
          do these. I then did these things first. At times I found it hard not to spend too much time on things like font 
          sizing and colours as I wanted it to look nice too. 
        </p>
        <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
        <p>
          Before starting this course (and for this first two weeks) meditation was something that I thought wasn’t really 
          for me. Having been a teacher you are always thinking of the next thing you have to do and (to be honest) I thought 
          meditation was a waste of my time.
        </p>
        <h3> What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
        <p>
          I have learnt that meditation takes time and you have to train your mind! Before reading this, I didn’t know that 
          there is “no such thing as a bad meditation”. I thought that having you attention wandering wasn’t great. However, 
          I have since learnt that this is part of the process of training your mind. When we are having to bring our attention 
          back this is helping you grow and train your mind.
        </p>
        <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
        <p>
          The 4 step plan to work on distractions really stood out for me. The four steps are:
          <div class="list">
            <ol>
              <li>Acknowledge</li>
              <li>Experience without judging or reacting</li>
              <li>If you need to react, continue maintaining mindfulness</li>
              <li>Let it go</li>
            </ol>  
            I think that sometimes I can be quick to act on a distraction and by going through these four steps it would 
            allow me to process that distraction without having to lose mindfulness. 
        </p>
        <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
        <p>
          I found it interesting when it said happiness is a default state of mind and when you mind is clear it returns to 
          the default of happiness.
