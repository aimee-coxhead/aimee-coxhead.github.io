      <h2>Connecting</h2>
      <h3>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
      <p>
        I haven’t tried to do this yet but I know I need to be more open with people (this is something that 
        I will find difficult to do). I tend to be closed off to everyone and don’t trust people until they 
        prove themself to me. I need to do the opposite of this and assume that they are a good person who I 
        can trust until they prove otherwise.
      </p>
      <h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
      <p>
        When I was listening I initially felt a little awkward when I started to give feedback for feelings. Once 
        we started talking I could see that the speaker appreciated what I was saying and it made me feel more 
        comfortable. After the conversation they said that they felt that I really understood what they were saying 
        and feeling. From doing this exercise I have learnt that there are time where I need to use empathic 
        listening more. Sometimes the speaker doesn’t want you to solve the problem but instead wants you to just 
        listen to how they felt about the situation.
      </p>
      <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
      <p>
        I found myself genuinely wishing that person happiness and that made me happy to. I can see how this 
        meditation could be applied to anyone including someone who you may find frustrating. It reminds you that 
        everyone makes mistakes and we all want to be happy!
      </p>

      <h5>Describe the situation as though you are 100 percent correct and reasonable.</h5>
      <p>
        In six form we were playing baseball as part of school P.E. When I hit the ball and started running two people 
        from the other team grabbed me and held me down so that their team could collect the ball and then get me out. 
        The P.E teacher allowed it and I was sent out. This was incredible frustrating to me so I told the teacher that 
        she needed to learn the rules… especially if she was going to teach P.E (whoops!) and left.
      </p>
      <h5>Now describe the situation as though the other person (teacher in this case) is 100 percent correct and reasonable.</h5>
      <p>
        When the girls grabbed Aimee I thought it was just a bit of fun and I called her as out. It was just a game so I thought 
        it wouldn't matter much to her.
