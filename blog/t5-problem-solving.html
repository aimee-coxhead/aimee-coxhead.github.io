      <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
      <h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
      <p>  
        During sprint 4 we had to do a number of exercise on freeCodeCamp. Some of these I found really tricky. 
        To solve the problems I thought about what I knew already, I tried to talk out loud to myself to see if 
        I could make sense of the problem and I also went back and redid some of the previous exercises again. At 
        times I felt frustrated because I wasn’t able to understand the question and code. I learned during these 
        times it was best for me to go and do something else and then I could come back to it with a fresh and much 
        clearer perspective. 
      </p>
      <h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you solved a problem in an elegant way</h3>
      <p>
          When I was redesigning my website I really wanted to have a drop down box for the blogs. To do this I 
          googled how to do it and I found a really helpfully YouTube video. I was able to follow the steps on 
          the video and create a drop down box. Unfortunately, when it was done it was stuck on the left hand side 
          of my website. I had everything else on my website centered so it looked out of place and I wasn’t really 
          happy with it. After some more googling and just trying things out I was able to get it to the center of 
          my page. I was so happy when it worked! I learned a lot from just playing with the code to see what would 
          happen when I changed certain things.
      </p>


      <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h3>
      <h5>Pseudocode</h5>
      <p>
        I like using pseudocode. I feel that this allows me to think about what I need to do in order to 
        solve the problem and what the steps are.
      </p>
      <h5>Trying something</h5>
      <p>I like trying things as then I have something that I can run, and I can get ideas from there. 
      </p>
      <h5>Rubber ducky method</h5>
      <p>
        I haven’t tried talking to a rubber ducky but I do talk out loud to myself (when no one is around). I find 
        that talking the problem over makes me think about what I do know and gives me a place to start. 
      </p>
      <h5>Reading error messages</h5>
      <p>
        I don’t feel confident reading error messages. I have just learned how to use the inspect tool and 
        then go to console to check to see what is logging to the console. If there is an error it would give 
        a line that this error is on and means that I have a place to start to check my code.
      </p> 
      <h5>Console.logging</h5>
      <p>
        Again, I am not very confident with this.
      </p>
      <h5>Googling</h5>
      <p>
        This is something that I have found very helpful. The trick has been to us the right keywords so 
        that you return the information you are looking for. 
      </p>
      <h5>Asking your peers for help</h5>
      <p>
        This is something that I hope I will be able to use during bootcamp. At the moment, I feel because 
        I don’t really know anyone well I have been reluctant to ask for help and relied more on the other 
        strategies. The two main things that have stopped my from asking others is I don’t always know what 
        is wrong and I am also not too sure I would understand their answer because I have a very basic 
        knowledge. It has been nice to see that when other people are blocked they have reached out on the 
        slack channel and got a really positive response from others. I think that this has encouraged me 
        to know that if I did get stuck I could ask for help from my peers and it would be okay.
      </p>
      <h5>Asking coaches for help</h5>
      <p>
        As above, I haven’t asked the coaches for help.
      </p>
      <h5>Improving your process with reflection</h5>
      <p>
        I haven’t utilised this strategy as much as I probably should have. Reflection was something that we 
        did all the time in my previous job so I know the value in it. I am going to try and use this strategy more 
        often as I think it would be very useful.
