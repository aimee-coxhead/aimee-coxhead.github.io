      <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
      <h3>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML is the basic structure and contents of a website. CSS is the design of a webpage, how 
        everything looks and where elements are. JavaScript is the interactivity on a webpage which 
        helps engage a user and make it more interesting.

      <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 
        'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h3>
      <p>
          Control flow is the way in which statements are executed from top to bottom. For example something 
          happens first, then the second thing happens after you have executed the first thing. A loop is 
          where you can run the code over and over each time with a different value.
          <br>
          <br>
          To relate this to brushing your teeth your control flow would be brushing your top teeth first 
          and then brushing your bottom teeth. The loop would be to brush a tooth and then move on to the 
          next tooth until all the teeth are brushed in that row.
      </p>
      <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
      <p>
          When you are accessing data from an array you use the index number. For example, if you had 
          var colours = [“yellow”, “pink”, “orange”] and you wanted to access the first element in the 
          array you use colours[0] and this would return “yellow”.
          <br>
          <br>
          Objects use names to access its properties. This could be done by using the dot notation. For 
          example if you had var person = { firstName: “Aimee” , lastName: “Coxhead”} and you wanted to 
          access the last name, you could use person.lastName.
      </p>
      <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
      <p>
          A function is a block of code that you can use to perform a particular task. It is useful because 
          the whole code will be executed when something calls it. This means you do not need to write the 
          same code again and again, you just need to call the function and it will execute the whole code 
          for you.
