    <h2>Time and Habits</h2>
    <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
    <p>
      I tried meditation and downloaded the Headspace app. I also tried timeboxing and found the evaluation
      at the end really helpful.
    </p>
    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
    <p>
      I found the article on Habits and Growth Mindset really interesting. As I mentioned in my 
      <a href="c1-reflection-blog.html"> reflection</a> one of my fears was that 
      "I don't know that much". It really resonated with me when I read "prove it to yourself in
      small ways and you'll develop the confidence that you can improve". On reflection, I looked
      back at what I knew on Wednesday morning (which was nothing) and in the past 5 days I have
      been able to learn the very basics of Command Line, GitHub and HTML. I can already see how
      much my confidence in using these has grown! I understand that I have a lot to learn but I 
      am beginning to feel that I can do this. And this makes me <strong> very excited!</strong>
    </p>
    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
    <p>
      I think what worked for me is breaking things down into smaller tasks and just focusing on those. 
      Over time these add up and you can achieve something that you may not have thought you could do at
      the beginning when you looked at the whole task.
    </p>
    <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <p>
      I have downloaded the Headspace app and will keep working on meditation. I found that during the first meditation
      session my mind kept wandering to other things. I am going to try and use the Fogg Method to stick with this for the
      next ten days. After I brush my teeth in the morning, I am going to do 2 minutes meditation.
