    <h2>HTML CSS and DOM Part 1</h2>
   <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? <br> How would you describe it to 
    your non-technical friend?</h3>
    <p>
      I would compare it to setting up a classroom.<br><br> HTML is your structure and content. This
      would be things like how many chairs and tables there are and where they are placed in your 
      classroom. It would also be what information will be on your walls (e.g. a maths wall, reading
      wall ect) and were these walls are.<br><br> CSS is the style you would like. This would be 
      what colour and shape you would like your tables to be. It would also be how the information 
      on the different walls would be displayed (e.g fonts, spacing and background colours).<br><br> 
      The DOM would be the teacherâ€™s mental model of what the class should be constructed like.  They 
      would take the structure and style and put it together in a way they understand and then can 
      act on.

    <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
    <p>
      It is when you take every element on the webpage and divide it into boxes. A box can have other 
      boxes inside it. For example, a header could have a box around it and then inside the header 
      there could be a title which could have a box and then an image which could also have a box.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
    <p>
      Everything on a webpage is given a box. The box model shows how everything in the box relates/ 
      is laid out. At the center of the box is the <em>content</em>. This could be your writing or 
      image. The other layers go around the content. The next layer is the <em>padding</em> and this 
      is the space around the content.The third layer is the <em>border</em>. The border goes around 
      the content and the padding. The <em>margin</em> is the last layer and this is the space around
      the border.
