      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
      <p>
        Tony Hsieh describes three types of happiness. The first one is pleasure. Life through this lens 
        would be about pursuing the next thing that makes you happy. The second type of happiness is 
        passion. Life through this lens would mean that you are engaged in what you are doing and you are 
        doing a good job at it. The last type of happiness is higher purpose. Life through this lens would 
        mean that you are contributing to something that is bigger than yourself. 
      </p>
      <h3>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, What are your core values? What do you stand for?</h3>
      <p>
        My core value would be family. To have people around me that are loyal, dependable and who support 
        me is something that I think is very important. I would stand for being true to yourself, being able 
        to be your own individual and respecting what people have to say while also having the courage to 
        stand up for yourself and your beliefs. 
      </p>
      <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
      <p>
        During the meditation exercise I found it difficult to experience the emotions without grasping 
        or aversion. Reading through the Emotional Resilience section I think this is something that I 
        will need to work on as I don’t won’t to let success or failure hold me back.
      </p>
      <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
      <p>
        “People want to be inspired!” Last year I had an experience with this in my job. I really wanted to 
        implement something in our school that would benefit all of our our junior school students. By sharing 
        this idea with everyone in my team, they were able to see how passionate I was about it and they all 
        wanted to help out! In the end we were all able to work together for this greater goal. Sometimes we 
        need to share our ideas with others so that you can achieve something that may not have been possible 
        by yourself.
